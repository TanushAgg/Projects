I created an interactive dashboard based on AdventureWorks database on Power BI. The dashboard can be used track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. This dashboard was created by transforming raw
dataset, DAX measures and Power BI visuals.
